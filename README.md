# Blueshift Game User Settings Plugin
Extension to the GameUserSettings class to allow for extended support, event hooks, and Blueprint support.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Luna-Blueshift/BlueshiftGameSettings/wiki) for documentation.

Binaries have been provided for Unreal Engine 5.5.
If you wish to use the plugin with a different version you must compile it yourself until we figure out a better way to host multiple binaries for different engine versions.
